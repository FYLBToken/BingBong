BingBong White Paper March 7, 2022
A Hyper-Deflationary Reflection Token With a Lottery Interface
BingBong Token is a fair launch cryptocurrency that rewards holders with 5% reflections. Holders will
receive the benefits of a 2% burn with each transaction as well as Lottery Burns. Holders will also receive
reflections from BingBong Energy Limited. All net profits from the energy drink & merchandise will be
redistributed to holders via BingBong Token–allowing the community of holders to benefit from BingBong
Limited’ subsidiary company, BingBong Energy Limited.
Tokenomics
With each purchase & sale of BingBong Tokens there is a 10% fee. 5% is redistributed to all holders. 2%
is burned. 3% is used for liquidity. On top of the 5% redistribution, token holders will receive 100% of net
profits from Bing Bong Energy products.
Bing Bong Protocol
Bingbong is an ERC-20 governance and utility token to empower a decentralized community at the
forefront of web3, energy products and professional athlete endorsements.
Unification of Spend: Bing Bong is the ecosystem's utility token, giving all its participants a shared and
open defi-currency to be used without centralized intermediaries.
Access: BingBong Token provides holders access to NFT’s, Exclusive events and other opportunities
unavailable to non-token holders which will be announced at a later date.
BingBong Token ALLOCATION
The total supply of BingBong Token is 1 quadrillion. Through the Lottery Burn interface the community
and its voting powers will determine the amount and rate of burn up to 900 trillion tokens leaving a
minimum supply of 100 trillion tokens. The Lottery Burn interface will undoubtedly reward early adopters
of the token.
BingBong Meta Card
The BingBong Meta Card will be built on the ethereum network and will bring incentives to holders. It will
give access to live events as well as metaverse expansion events. Holders will also receive staking
incentives and royalties.
